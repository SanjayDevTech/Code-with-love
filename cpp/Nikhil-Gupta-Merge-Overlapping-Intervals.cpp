//Merge Overlapping Subintervals
/*
A simple approach is to start from the first interval 
and compare it with all other intervals for overlapping, 
if it overlaps with any other interval, 
then remove the other interval from list and merge the other into the first interval.
Repeat the same steps for remaining intervals after first. 
This approach cannot be implemented in better than O(n^2) time.


An efficient approach is to first sort the intervals according to starting time. Once we have the sorted intervals, we can combine all intervals in a linear traversal. The idea is, in sorted array of intervals, if interval[i] doesnâ€™t overlap with interval[i-1], then interval[i+1] cannot overlap with interval[i-1] because starting time of interval[i+1] must be greater than or equal to interval[i]. Following is the detailed step by step algorithm.

1. Sort the intervals based on increasing order of 
    starting time.
2. Push the first interval on to a stack.
3. For each interval do the following
   a. If the current interval does not overlap with the stack 
       top, push it.
   b. If the current interval overlaps with stack top and ending
       time of current interval is more than that of stack top, 
       update stack top with the ending  time of current interval.
4. At the end stack contains the merged intervals.

/*
A O(n Log n) and O(1) Extra Space Solution
The above solution requires O(n) extra space for stack. 
We can avoid use of extra space by doing merge operations in-place. Below are detailed steps.

1) Sort all intervals in decreasing order of start time.
2) Traverse sorted intervals starting from first interval, 
   do following for every interval.
      a) If current interval is not first interval and it 
         overlaps with previous interval, then merge it with
         previous interval. Keep doing it while the interval
         overlaps with the previous one.         
      b) Else add current interval to output list of intervals.
Note that if intervals are sorted by decreasing order of start times, 
we can quickly check if intervals overlap or not by comparing start time of previous interval with end time of current interval.
